Example Input:
​
private static String text =
            "As Michael Harvey writes, paragraphs are \"in essence—a form of punctuation, and like other forms of punctuation they are meant to make written material easy to read.\"[1] Effective paragraphs are the fundamental units of academic writing; consequently, the thoughtful, multifaceted arguments that your professors expect depend on them. Without good paragraphs, you simply cannot clearly convey sequential points and their relationships to one another. \n"
            + "\n"
            + "Many novice writers tend to make a sharp distinction between content and style, thinking that a paper can be strong in one and weak in the other, but focusing on organization shows how content and style converge in deliberative academic writing. Your professors will view even the most elegant prose as rambling and tedious if there isn't a careful, coherent argument to give the text meaning. Paragraphs are the "stuff " of academic writing and, thus, worth our attention here.\n"
            + "\n"
            + "Key Sentences (a.k.a. Topic Sentences)\n"
            + "Gold keyIn academic writing, readers expect each paragraph to have a sentence or two that captures its main point. They're often called \"topic sentences,\" though many writing instructors prefer to call them "key sentences." There are at least two downsides of the phrase "topic sentence." First, it makes it seem like the paramount job of that sentence is simply to announce the topic of the paragraph. Second, it makes it seem like the topic sentence must always be a single grammatical sentence. Calling it a "key sentence" reminds us that it expresses the central idea of the paragraph. And sometimes a question or a two-sentence construction functions as the key.";
